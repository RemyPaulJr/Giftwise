# GiftWise — MVP Scope Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-19  
**Status:** Approved

---

## Purpose

This document defines the scope of the GiftWise Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It establishes what is in scope, what is explicitly out of scope, the core user flows, and the acceptance criteria for each feature. All Kanban tickets for v1 are derived from this document.

## Problem Statement

Finding the right gift for someone is hard. People often default to generic gifts because they don't know where to start. GiftWise solves this by taking what you know about a person — their hobbies, interests, and a budget — and using AI to generate thoughtful, personalized gift ideas.

---

## MVP Goal

Ship a working, deployable full-stack web application where a user can:
1. Create an account and log in
2. Add a gift recipient with their details
3. Generate AI-powered gift suggestions for that recipient
4. Save those suggestions to a private list
5. Rate and comment on individual suggestions
6. Regenerate suggestions if they aren't satisfied
7. Filter suggestions by budget

## In Scope (MVP)

### Authentication
- User registration (email + password)
- User login / logout
- Protected routes — unauthenticated users cannot access app features
- JWT-based session management

### Dashboard
- A simple home screen displayed after login
- Shows a list of the user's saved recipients
- Entry point to create a new recipient or view an existing one

### Recipient Management
- Create a recipient with: name, hobbies (free text), interests (free text), budget (dropdown or input)
- View a list of saved recipients on the dashboard
- View an individual recipient's details and their saved gift list

### Gift Suggestion Generation
- On a recipient's page, trigger AI generation to produce gift suggestions
- Suggestions are generated by the Python AI service via OpenAI
- Each suggestion includes: title, short description, reason it fits the recipient
- Budget is passed to the AI as a filter parameter
- Generated suggestions are saved to the database automatically

### Regenerate Suggestions
- User can request a new set of suggestions for a recipient
- Previous suggestions are retained in the database (not overwritten)
- New suggestions are appended as a new generation batch

### Feedback
- User can rate each suggestion with 1–5 stars
- User can leave a short text comment on each suggestion
- Feedback is saved to the database and displayed alongside the suggestion
- A user can only submit one rating per suggestion (can update it)

### Budget Filter
- When creating or editing a recipient, user sets a budget range (e.g. Under $25 / $25–$50 / $50–$100 / $100+)
- Budget is included in the prompt sent to the AI service
- Frontend displays the budget associated with a recipient

## Out of Scope (MVP)

These are explicitly deferred to post-MVP. Do not build these for v1.

- Sharing lists publicly or via link
- Multiple users collaborating on a list
- Email notifications or reminders
- OAuth / social login (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Editing or deleting recipients
- Deleting individual suggestions
- Searching or filtering recipients
- Pagination (acceptable to load all records for MVP volume)
- Dark mode or theme switching
- Mobile-optimized responsive design (best effort only)
- Admin panel or moderation tools
- Analytics or usage tracking
- Refresh token flow (short-lived JWT is acceptable for MVP)
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/CDK) — manual AWS setup is fine for MVP

## User Flows

### Flow 1 — New User Registration
1. User visits the app
2. User clicks "Sign Up"
3. User enters email and password
4. Account is created, user is redirected to the dashboard

### Flow 2 — Add a Recipient and Generate Suggestions
1. Logged-in user is on the dashboard
2. User clicks "Add Recipient"
3. User fills in: name, hobbies, interests, budget
4. User submits the form — recipient is saved
5. User is taken to the recipient's page
6. User clicks "Generate Gift Ideas"
7. App calls the Go API → Python AI service → OpenAI
8. Suggestions are returned, saved, and displayed on the page
9. Each suggestion shows: title, description, reason

### Flow 3 — Rate a Suggestion
1. User is viewing a recipient's suggestion list
2. User clicks a star rating (1–5) on a suggestion
3. User optionally types a short comment
4. User submits — feedback is saved and displayed

### Flow 4 — Regenerate Suggestions
1. User is on a recipient's page
2. User clicks "Regenerate Ideas"
3. A new batch of suggestions is generated and saved
4. New suggestions appear alongside or below the previous batch (clearly labelled by generation)

### Flow 5 — Return Visit
1. User logs in
2. Dashboard shows all previously saved recipients
3. User clicks a recipient to view their saved suggestions and feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

| Feature | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Registration | User can register with email + password. Duplicate emails are rejected. |
| Login | User can log in and receive a JWT. Invalid credentials return an error. |
| Dashboard | Logged-in user sees their list of recipients. Empty state shown if none exist. |
| Add Recipient | Form validates required fields. Recipient is saved and appears on dashboard. |
| Generate Suggestions | Clicking generate returns at least 3 suggestions within 10 seconds. Suggestions are persisted. |
| Budget Filter | Budget selection is passed to AI. Suggestions are relevant to the budget. |
| Regenerate | New suggestions are generated without deleting previous ones. Generation batches are distinguishable. |
| Feedback | User can submit a 1–5 star rating and optional comment. Rating can be updated. Only one rating per suggestion per user. |
| Auth Guard | Unauthenticated users are redirected to login when accessing protected routes. |

## Success Criteria for MVP

The MVP is considered complete when:
- A user can complete all 5 flows end-to-end without errors
- The app is deployed and accessible via a public URL on AWS
- The codebase is on GitHub with ADRs, this scope doc, and a README
- Each resume keyword appears meaningfully in the codebase: Go, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, AWS, SQL, AI
